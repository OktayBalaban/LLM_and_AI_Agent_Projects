# LLM and AI Agent Projects

Welcome to the repository showcasing my experimental and production-ready AI agent projects, built with Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrated AI services.

This repository hosts documentation and links to live demos deployed on Hugging Face Spaces. Each project focuses on combining **natural language processing**, **structured data querying**, and **agentic reasoning** with real-world use cases.

## üîó Live Demos

### ‚úÖ [CV & Job Post Evaluator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OktayBalaban/CV_JobPost_Evaluator)

An AI-powered tool that evaluates the compatibility between a **job post** and a **CV/resume**.  
- Upload a CV (PDF/text) and a job description.
- The model analyzes the match and outputs a compatibility score and explanation.
- Ideal for recruiters and candidates to assess alignment.

‚û°Ô∏è Built with OpenAI/Gemini LLM, integrated with a simple Gradio frontend.

### ‚úÖ [Okt.ai ‚Äì SQL Query AI Agent](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OktayBalaban/Okt.ai?logs=container)

An interactive AI agent that:
- Accepts **natural language queries** (e.g., "show the top 10 most used materials last month").
- Converts them into **SQL queries** dynamically.
- Connects to an **AWS RDS (MySQL)** database and fetches real data.
- Displays the results in a user-friendly table.

Tech stack:
- LLM (OpenAI, Gemini) for NL-to-SQL translation.
- Python backend with SQLAlchemy/MySQL connector.
- Gradio UI hosted on Hugging Face Spaces.

üëâ Ideal for warehouse management, stock reporting, or any structured query needs via natural language.

## üìù Why this repository?

Since **Hugging Face Spaces** is less known among Turkish developers, I wanted to make these AI tools more discoverable via GitHub.  
These projects demonstrate how to bridge LLMs with **database operations**, **document analysis**, and **real-world applications** using open-source deployment platforms.

Feel free to explore, test, and contribute!
