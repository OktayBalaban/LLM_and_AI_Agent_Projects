Welcome to the repository showcasing my experimental and production-ready AI agent projects, built with Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrated AI services.

This repository includes documentation and links to live projects deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.

## 🔗 Live Projects


### 🔤 [Wordle-Playing Agent](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OktayBalaban/Wordle_Playing_Agent)

An autonomous **Expert Wordle Solver** powered by an LLM-based agent.

- Automatically plays Wordle with strategic reasoning.

For the fully autonomous version that interacts with the actual Wordle game in the browser, see my other project:

### 🎚️ [ExTrackT – AI Instrument Extractor](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OktayBalaban/ExTrackT)

A user-friendly tool for **AI-based instrument extraction**.

- Upload any MP3 file.
- Choose which stems to include in the final mix.
- Download the **remixed result** as an MP3.

This app provides a practical way to use source separation models for musicians, producers, and audio hobbyists in everyday audio editing tasks.

A more advanced version, **SoundPilot**, is also available for local setup. 
SoundPilot accepts both song names and YouTube links, uses smart song recognition that tolerates typos, distinguishes live versions etc and automatically preapares the track with extracted instruments:

### 🎭 [Werewolf Game: Agent-Driven Role-Playing Experience](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OktayBalaban/Werewolf_Game)

An interactive, AI-powered version of the classic **Werewolf** social deduction game, enhanced with LLM-driven agent behavior.

- Play as the werewolf among NPCs with different characters.
- NPCs **discuss**, **accuse**, and **vote** based on evolving context and memory.
- Built with **LLM-based character logic**, **dialogue parsing**, and **turn-based reasoning**.
- Demonstrates how agents can simulate **emergent social interaction** without scripted logic.

### 📄 [CV & Job Post Evaluator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OktayBalaban/CV_JobPost_Evaluator)

An AI-powered tool that evaluates the compatibility between a **CV/resume** and a **job description**.

- Upload a CV and a job post.
- The model analyzes both and generates a **compatibility score** with reasoning.
- Useful for both recruiters and candidates.

### 🧮 [SQL Query AI Agent](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OktayBalaban/Okt.ai?logs=container)

A natural language–to–SQL agent designed for real-world database interaction.

- Accepts **natural language queries** (e.g., "What were the top 5 vendors last week?")
- Translates them into **safe SQL queries** (blocks INSERT, DELETE, DROP, etc.)
- Connects to a live **AWS RDS (MySQL)** database.
- Returns results in a readable table format.

## 📌 Why this repository?

Since many of these tools are hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**, I created this repository to make them easier to find, explore, and try out.
