# LLM and AI Agent Projects

Welcome to the repository showcasing my experimental and production-ready AI agent projects, built with Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrated AI services.

This repository hosts documentation and links to live demos deployed on **HuggingFace Spaces**.

## 🔗 Live Demos

### [CV & Job Post Evaluator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OktayBalaban/CV_JobPost_Evaluator)

An AI-powered tool that evaluates the compatibility between a **job post** and a **CV/resume**.

- Upload a CV and a job description.
- The model analyzes the match and outputs a compatibility score and explanation.
- Ideal for recruiters and candidates to assess alignment.

### [Okt.ai – SQL Query AI Agent](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OktayBalaban/Okt.ai?logs=container)

An interactive AI agent that:

- Accepts **natural language queries** (e.g., "show the top 10 most used materials last month").
- Converts them into **SQL queries** dynamically.
- Filters manipulative queries such as INSERT, DELETE, DROP etc. and only runs safe ones such as SELECT, DESCRIBE.
- Connects to an **AWS RDS (MySQL)** database.
- Displays the results in a user-friendly table.

## Why this repository?

Since **HuggingFace Spaces** is less known among many developers, I wanted to make these AI tools more discoverable via GitHub.

You can view all my live Spaces and models on my Hugging Face profile:
