# 🧠 LLM and AI Agent Projects

Welcome to the repository showcasing my experimental and production-ready AI agent projects, built with Large Language Models (LLMs) and integrated AI services.

This repository includes documentation and links to **live demos deployed on Hugging Face Spaces**.

### 🔤 [Wordle-Playing Agent](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OktayBalaban/Wordle_Playing_Agent)

An autonomous Wordle solver powered by an LLM-based agent.

### 🎭 [Werewolf Game: Agent-Driven Role-Playing Experience](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OktayBalaban/Werewolf_Game)

An interactive, AI-powered version of the classic **Werewolf** social deduction game, enhanced with LLM-driven agent behavior.

- Play as the werewolf among NPCs with different characters.
- NPCs **discuss**, **accuse**, and **vote** based on evolving context and memory.
- Built with **LLM-based character logic**, **dialogue parsing**, and **turn-based reasoning**.
- Demonstrates how agents can simulate **emergent social interaction** without scripted logic.

### 📄 [CV & Job Post Evaluator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OktayBalaban/CV_JobPost_Evaluator)

An AI-powered tool that evaluates the compatibility between a **CV/resume** and a **job description**.

- Upload a CV and a job post.
- The model analyzes both and generates a **compatibility score** with reasoning.
- Useful for both recruiters and candidates.

### 🧮 [SQL Query AI Agent](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OktayBalaban/Okt.ai?logs=container)

A natural language–to–SQL agent designed for real-world database interaction.

- Accepts **natural language queries** (e.g., "What were the top 5 vendors last week?")
- Translates them into **safe SQL queries** (blocks INSERT, DELETE, DROP, etc.)
- Connects to a live **AWS RDS (MySQL)** database.
- Returns results in a readable table format.

## 📌 Why this repository?

Since many of these tools are hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**, I created this repository to make them easier to find, explore, and try out.
